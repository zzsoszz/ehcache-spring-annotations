# Ehcache Annotations for Spring #

A successor in spirit of the annotations provided by the Spring-Modules Cache library that allows declarative, aspect based caching to be added to a [Spring Framework](http://www.springsource.org) based application by simple annotation.

Ehcache Annotations for Spring is available via maven, simply add the following dependency to your pom.xml

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.googlecode.ehcache-spring-annotations</groupId>
  <artifactId>ehcache-spring-annotations</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you're new to EhCache please read their [Getting Started with EhCache](http://ehcache.org/documentation/getting_started.html) documentation before digging into this library. EhCache Spring Annotations is an addition to Spring & EhCache, it still requires you have a working knowledge of both technologies.

To get started, read the documentation on using [@Cacheable](UsingCacheable.md) and [@TriggersRemove](UsingTriggersRemove.md).

Also take a look at this [Quick Start](http://blog.goyello.com/2010/07/29/quick-start-with-ehcache-annotations-for-spring/) article by Rafa≈Ç Borowiec.
